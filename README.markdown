# Amazon ECS PHP Library Version 1.3
AmazonECS is a class which searchs products and fetchs information
about it from tha amazon productdatabase.

See a working Search-Demo at: http://amazonecs.pixel-web.org

This is realized by the Product Advertising API (former ECS) from Amazon WS Front.
https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/gp/advertising/api/detail/main.html

The AmazonECS class fetchs productinformation via SOAP Requests directly from the Amazon-Database.

It supports four basic operations: ItemSearch, ItemLookup, BrowseNodeLookup, SimilarityLookup

These operations could be expanded with extra prarmeters to specialize the query.

Requirement is the PHP extension SOAP.

## Basic Usage:
The usage is quite simple.
Just require the class, create a new object of it and it's ready to use.
Nothing else to configure.

You just need to pass a categoryname whem doing searches.

``` php
<?php

require_once 'lib/AmazonECS.class.php';
$client = new AmazonECS('YOUT API KEY', 'YOUR SECRET KEY', 'DE', 'YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG');

$response  = $client->category('Books')->search('PHP 5');
var_dump($response);
```

For some very simple examples go to the samples-folder and have a look at the sample files.
These files contain all information you need for building querys successful.
