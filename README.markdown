#Amazon ECS PHP Library Version 1.3
AmazonECS is a class which searches products and fetches information about it from the amazon product database.

See a working Search-Demo at: http://amazonecs.pixel-web.org

This is realized by the Product Advertising API (former ECS) from Amazon WS Front.

The AmazonECS class fetches product information via SOAP requests directly from the Amazon-Database.

It supports four basic operations: ItemSearch, ItemLookup, BrowseNodeLookup, SimilarityLookup

These operations could be expanded with extra prarmeters to specialize the query.

Requirement is the PHP extension SOAP.

##Basic Usage:
The usage is quite simple.
Just require the class, create a new object and it's ready to use.
Nothing else to configure.

You just need to pass a category name when doing searches.

``` php
<?php

require_once 'lib/AmazonECS.class.php';
$client = new AmazonECS('YOUR API KEY', 'YOUR SECRET KEY', 'DE', 'YOUR ASSOCIATE TAG');

$response  = $client->category('Books')->search('PHP 5');
var_dump($response);
```

For some very simple examples go to the samples-folder and have a look at the sample files.
These files contain all information you need for building queries successful.
